            <h1>Initial Research</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Initial Research that informed my idea. This project was inspired by two key areas of research. The first stems from the sustainability research I conducted last year in our Design Studio class. The second comes from my professional focus in branding and design, as well as past research in that field. I enjoy developing hypothetical brands. I also enjoy exploring how design can strengthen community. This, combined with my interest in sustainability came together to form the concept for SuperEtte.</p>

            <h2>What I Learned From This Initial Research</h2>
            <p class="section-description">After looking at the online and local sustainability market, I realized there are definitely similar sustainability concepts out there. This was a really awesome surprise. I'm definitely making it a point to go visit all the ones in my area. However, there was no concert-hosting art-showing community-focused store! I think due to the unique nature of Superette it has the capacity to be successful even in a market with competition. Hypothetically, I think there would also be a great opportunity for these stores that exist in Kansas City to collaborate. The more sustainability, the better!</p>
