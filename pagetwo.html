                        <h3>Mood Board & Theme Development</h3>
                        <p>This was the beginning of my process. After establishing the theme of my project, I went to Pinterest to curate a mood board for the rest of my project. The subject matter of many of these images are whimsical, hand-drawn, and human-centered. You can definitely see evidence of this mood board in my end product.</p>

                        <p>This image represents my initial sketches for SuperEtte. It was at this point in my process where I transitioned from human limbs to a more minimalist human approach. I ultimately decided to use a simple smiley face character in my logos.</p>

                        <p>This is where things started coming together! This phase represents the last major turning point in my process. I ended up ditching the "S" and smiley face combination for just the simple smiley face. With this change, the brand pattern was updated as well.</p>

                    <h4>What emotion are the assets currently evoking?</h4>
                    <p>I curated my brand assets throughout to convey the values of the brand which is made up of a casual, compassionate, and cheerful presence.</p>

                <div class="question-card">
                    <h4>Is this concept reading as approachable or as cookie cutter?</h4>
                    <p>It was important to me that this brand be easy to digest but to have a unique hand-drawn presence. I went through different levels of whimsy to achieve the result I wanted.</p>

                    <h4>What will make this brand unique and memorable?</h4>
                    <p>I challenged myself to avoid the standard blues, greens, and browns that are normally associated with eco-brands and stuck with a unique color palette and imagery instead.</p>
