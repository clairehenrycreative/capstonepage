            <h1>Project Summary</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">This SuperEtte branding project was a great endpoint to where I started at the beginning of my journey at MCAD. This project represents where my focus is professionally while leaving room for growth. Although I've learned a lot throughout my research in sustainability through my design studio project last semester as well as my project this semester, it's something I'd like to incorporate significantly more into my professional practice going forward. I've started bringing it into my projects when opportunities arise, but I know there's a whole world of possibilities out there I've barely scratched the surface of. I also loved the community piece of this project. I wanted to intentionally explore that on a large scale as it's something I'm passionate about in my day-to-day life. Seeing the positive impact of my professional work on small businesses in my community has been incredibly fulfilling and I wanted to experiment with what that could look like on a larger scale. Overall, I had a really wonderful time putting SuperEtte together and it challenged me to think way beyond where I typically do in a branding process. I can't wait to continue using these skills I learned at MCAD and exploring what the future brings!</p>
